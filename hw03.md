   int8_t x = 0xd3 （int8_t的值域范围是[-128,127],而0xd3的取值为16*13+3=211）

   4）int8_t z = y - x（z的取值为-134超出int8_t的值域范围)

*  ## 精度误差

   float x = 0.45(float型数据是用2的次方形式表现的，而0.45经过计算后是一个无限循环的数字，因此存在精度误差)

*  ### [](#)Method of complements

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

*  ### []()Byte

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

*  ### []()Integer

An integer (from the Latin integer meaning "whole") is a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 1/2, and √2 are not.

The set of integers consists of zero (0), the positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …), also called whole numbers or counting numbers,and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., −1, −2, −3, …). The set of integers is often denoted by a boldface Z ("Z") or blackboard bold {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } \mathbb {Z}  (Unicode U+2124 ℤ) standing for the German word Zahlen "numbers")

*  ### []()Floating Point

In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen. A number that can be represented exactly is of the following form:

where significand is an integer (i.e., in Z), base is an integer greater than or equal to two, and exponent is also an integer. For example:

*  ## []()3.1 NAN ,which means not a number,is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.
