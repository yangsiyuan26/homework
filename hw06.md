# homework part 1 of 1

* ## According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a computer.

1.必须有一个存储器;2:必须有一个控制器;3:必须有一个运算器，用于完成算术运算和逻辑运算;4:必须有输入设备和输出设备，用于进行人机通信。:另外，程序和数据统一存储并在程序控制下自动工作

* ## A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory?

需要24位。

* ## 3、List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?

不包括。

* ## What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC. 

一种与主存储器相连的辅助存储器，是磁存储介质。比如U盘，光碟，闪存卡，他们都是二级存储器。

* ## 5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念： CPU、RAM、ROM、Bus (computing)、Parallel Computing

## CPU

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

## RAM

Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

## Bus (computing)

In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

Early computer buses were parallel electrical wires with multiple hardware connections, but the term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical function as a parallel electrical bus. Modern computer buses can use both parallel and bit serial connections, and can be wired in either a multidrop (electrical parallel) or daisy chain topology, or connected by switched hubs, as in the case of USB.

## Parallel Computing

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

* ## 6、写一段文字，简单解释“云计算（cloud computing）

过去在图中往往用云来表示电信网，后来也用来表示互联网和底层基础设施的抽象。云计算是一种按使用量付费的模式，这种模式提供可用的、便捷的、按需的网络访问， 进入可配置的计算资源共享池(资源包括网络，服务器，存储，应用软件，服务)，这些资源能够被快速提供，只需投入很少的管理工作，或与服务供应商进行很少的交互。


## 7、小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存， 最大支持16G” 1）DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么？ 2）小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？ 3）小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？ 4）16G需要多少位地址？
备注，维基百科（中文）“DDR3 SDRAM”

1)3是第三代储存条，1333是频率

2)不能，主板会将DDR3-1600自动识别成DDR3-1333。

3)可以，因为这个主板是双通道的，如果这个主板不是双通道的就不可以提高性能.无法自动识别双通道内存的情况还需要在BIOS里进行设置。（成功设置成双通道内存后，鲁大师会把内存识别成8GB而不是4GBx2）

4)34位
