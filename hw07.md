## Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle

计算机首先读取数据，变成汇编语言，再通过汇编器解码成为计算机能够理解的二进制编码， 将这些编码输送到CPU进行运算。再将结果由BUS输出，以此往复循环。

## Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU

IR：Instruction Register，指令寄存器，其功能是存放当前正在执行的指令。

PC：Program Counter，程序计数器，其功能是存放当前欲执行指令的地址，并可自动计数形成下一条指令地址。

ACC：Accumulator，累加器，是运算器中既能存放运算前的操作数，又能存放运算结果的寄存器。

## What are stored in memory?

以二进制的形式被存储在内存中

## Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?

指令和数据是可以存储在同一个地方的，但是需要用一些手段进行区分

## Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.


指令格式包括操作码和地址码，操作数的地址，操作结果的存储地址和下一条指令的地址。


# Explain  the fllowing vocabulary

## 汇编语言（Assembly Language）

An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

## 编译（Compiler）

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

## 命令式语言（Imperative programming）

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

## 函数编程语言（Functional programming）

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

## 过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC. Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
